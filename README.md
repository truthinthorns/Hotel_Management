# Hotel_Management

This project is written in Java using NetBeans. This project has a GUI for the user to check in/out customers from a nonexistent hotel. The code for this is, as I look at it some time later, quite unorganized and ugly. Some code is still left to implement: writing to a file when people check in/out, somehow displaying the unique IDs for each customer, etc.
